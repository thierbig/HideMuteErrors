# HideMuteErrors
HideMuteErrors is a lightweight World of Warcraft addon for WotLK 3.3.5a. It hides the red UI error text (e.g., "Not enough mana") and mutes associated error sounds, reducing on-screen clutter and audio distractions. Includes a toggle command (/hideerrors on|off) to show or hide errors and sounds as needed.
